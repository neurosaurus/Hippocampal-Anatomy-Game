I made this Choose Your Own Adventure-like game as practice after learning about functions, if-else statements, while loops, lists, dictionaries, and modules. I wanted to make an educational game that incorporated a deep interest of mine, neuroscience. So the subject of this game is a way to learn and explore one of the most studied regions in the brain, the hippocampus. The hippocampus is primarily known to be involved in memory and is located in the medial temporal lobe. Keep in mind: this region is very complex and this is only a crude (but hopefully fun) way to explore it. I really enjoyed reviewing the anatomy of the hippocampus and finding better ways to navigate through the game.
